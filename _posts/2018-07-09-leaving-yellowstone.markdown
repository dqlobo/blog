So yesterday I made the surprising decision to leave Yellowstone a day early. It is a beautiful place, and I thoroughly enjoyed the geysers and beautiful scenery, but having camped 40 minutes away from the park (it was packed) I decided to continue on - confident that there would be just as much excitement as I pressed on West. And there was.

Around 2pm, I was making a routine gas stop when I looked up from the pump and realized that I was standing in the center of a really neat town. Missoula, Montana is home to about 70,000 people - according to my Lyft driver later that night. I walked around, checked out some of the book stores and art gallerys when I started to get the itch to stay for the night. There is just so much to see in Missoula (I learned on a bathroom stall advertisement to check out missoulaevents.net)

After picking up a delicious beet and goat cheese empanada for $3, I met the owner of a pretty fancy Airbnb that is located just outside of town. Since it wasn’t occupied for the night, she was willing to give me a night for dirt cheap. I spent the rest of the day exploring Missoula - just my typical walking M.O. While exploring, I learned that Missoula is not only home to some great shops and breweries - but also people. Everyone I met (This may just be the rose colored glasses) was super friendly. It was an excellent time with excellent people.

This morning, Missoula continued to impress. I stopped in at a coffee shop for a quick espresso before I hit the road. It was in the entrance of a fitness center unfortunately, but the espresso was surprisingly great - even served with the seltzer water palette cleanser that the fancy places do. How much for that? Just $1.50.

I was extremely tempted to stay another day in Missoula, but with the same mindset of leaving Yellowstone, I continued West today. Maybe there’s something simple and alluring about driving out into the unknown.

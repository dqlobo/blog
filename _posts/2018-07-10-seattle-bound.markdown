On the advice of several Missoula locals, I headed up to the Flathead reservation to see the National Bison Range. The range is basically a safari for Northwestern animals - you can see anything ranging from Bison to Horned sheep, Antelope and Grizzly Bears. And non-surprisingly, I met some more great people along the drive - some folks from Tulsa and some others from Sydney.

After the tour, I picked up some of the local cherries (as instructed by my Airbnb host). I donâ€™t even like cherries, or so I thought! It turns out that the red candies on top of milkshakes (that I dread) are NOT REAL CHERRIES. I have been lied to this whole time! The real cherries I picked up in Flathead were massive and utterly delicious. I couldnâ€™t stop eating them and was forced to cut myself off after about twenty.

Before I knew it, the to set behind the scorched landscape of Eastern Washington. (I skipped talking about Idaho, but that was incredibly beautiful and worth itâ€™s own post eventually). Knowing that I wanted to camp and head into Mt. Rainier National Park tomorrow, I took Route 12, a state road that cuts through some beautiful forests and ends in the park.

My cell reception was spotty, but just about everywhere I went, I got a notification on my phone that there was a fire danger in the area for the next several days. This was discomforting to say the least. Now itâ€™s not bears that are my biggest concern - itâ€™s wildfires. I knew Iâ€™d have to sleep in the honey-scented tent tonight so I could smell the smoke just in case. (It was also interesting that almost everyone on Route 12 was leaving the forest, driving in the opposite direction of me :-0. On my next trip, I might just kidnap a park ranger so they can advise me on safety regardless of cell service ðŸ˜‚)

On a stroke of luck, I ended up on a beautiful lake, with no bears, no imminent wildfire danger, and available camp-sites for the night. (They also sell ice cream.) Turns out this place is a pretty family-friendly area. I was shocked to see families and children eating and walking around so freely in a camp ground (after the last few days of panicking in bear-country). Although this place is on the expensive end of campgrounds, I was able to enjoy a chocolate ice cream and build a modest fire (with some matches donated by my campsite neighbor). With absolute contentment, I finished off the day by watching the sunset over a beautiful lake while eating some hot soup.
